Users and Group

Creating the users

Command: useradd USERS_NAME

each user must have a password. 
To add passwords we use  passwd command 

syntax : passwd ******

to change the user "su" command is use 
i.e. su user_name

To find the user the "whoami" command is use


 create the groups 
command : groupadd
syntax: groupadd groupA

manage ownership and groups:

 To change the user/owner associated with file then use " chown  " command
syntax :  chown user_name
 To change the group associated with file then use  " chown :group_name file_name " format
To change the owner and group at the same time  then use "chown user_name:group_name file_name"


manage permissions

The change mode or chmod command sets permissions. The syntax is straight-forward:
chmod permissions resource-name

Access level	Octal value
Read	                      4
Write	                      2
Execute	                      1

Each identity (user, group, others) has a position:
Identity	Position
User	First or left-most
Group	Middle
Others	Last or right-most
 
SELinux  

Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a security architecture for Linux systems that allows administrators to have more control over who can access the system. It was originally developed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) as a series of patches to the Linux kernel using Linux Security Modules (LSM).  

SELinux was released to the open source community in 2000, and was integrated into the upstream Linux kernel in 2003.
