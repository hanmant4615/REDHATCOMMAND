Hardlink and softlink 

1. Create hard link to a file
To create a hard link to a file, you can use the ln command without any options like this:

 ln target_file link_name

2. Create soft link to a file
To create a symbolic link to a file, use the option -s with the target file name and the link name

syntax =  ln -s target_file link_name

3. Create soft link to a directory
Creating a soft link to a directory is the same as creating symbolic link to a file. You just need to replace the target file name/path with the directory name/path.

 syntax = ln -s target_directory link_name


The ln command has two options for this purpose:

-i: The interactive mode asks you if you want to overwrite the existing link.
-f: The force mode just updates the existing link without any confirmation.
